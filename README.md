# CSS-external
A simple CS:S external cheat

This cheat is based of [ImGuiExternal](https://github.com/furkankadirguzeloglu/ImGuiExternal) which is the overlay part of the program.<br>
The code isn't very good nor optimized but at least i have the good offsets.

# Features
* Ally/Ennemy ESP
* Skeleton ESP
* Box ESP
* Healthbar
* Name ESP
* Crosshair

# Usage
Compile in x64 Release mode.<br>
Start the game then launch the cheat.<br>
Press INSERT to open the menu.<br>
Press DELETE or "unhook" in the menu to unload the cheat.<br>
As i use an overlay you can easily stream your game with obs/discord without anyone seeing the ESP.<br>
