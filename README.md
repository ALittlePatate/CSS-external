# CSS-external
A simple CS:S external cheat

This cheat is based of [ImGuiExternal](https://github.com/furkankadirguzeloglu/ImGuiExternal) which is the overlay part of the program.
The code isn't very good nor optimized but at least i have the good offsets.

# Features

* Skeleton ESP
* Box ESP
* Healthbar
* Name ESP
* Crosshair

# Usage
Compile in x64 Release mode.

As i use an overlay you can easily stream your game with obs/discord without anyone seeing the ESP.
